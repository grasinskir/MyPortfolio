      <p>
        I am deeply interested in computer science and coding. In my free time,
        I enjoy coding games in Javascript and creating websites like this one.
        Computer Science and Coding began to interest me as I began high school.
        I made the choice to take an electronics class my junior year of high school
        instead of another year of foreign language so I could see if I enjoyed computers
        and coding in an academic context. In electronics, I experimented with an Arduino
        to create projects that intertwined coding and robotics. I also took a programming class
        in the second semester of my junior year that allowed me to experiment with Javascript and
        create games. I also taught myself HTML and CSS because I was interested in Web Design, but
        couldn't fit the class in my school schedule.
