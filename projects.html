      <h2><a href="https://grasinskir.github.io/Pong1972" target="_blank">Pong</a></h2>
        <p>Pong was the first game I ever programmed. I learned how to
          manipulate variables and functions in order to accomplish a certain
          task. I learned how to keep score, make a ball bounce within a certain
          area, and even set up a play button. I also learned how to count lives
          and make an object (the ball in this case) change velocity.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://grasinskir.github.io" target="_blank">Star Destroyer</a></h2>
      <p>Star Destroyer was my next big project after Pong. Here I learned how
      to incorporate arrays into my code and also multiple objects at once. I
      also learned how to add pictures and sound to my game, adding a spaceship
      aliens, and a background. I later recoded this game to incorporate <a href=
      "https://grasinskir.github.io/Star-Destroyer-Fork" target="_blank">object oriented
      </a> programming with Javascript. I turned the bullets and aliens into
      objects. If you play both games in the links below you will notice that the
      games run entirely the same (like they should).</p>

      <h2><a href="https://grasinskir.github.io/Flappy-Bison" target="_blank">Flappy Bison</a></h2>
      <p>Flappy Bison is my spin off of the once popular "Flappy Bird". I learned
      physics, the acceleration of the bison, to my program. I used completely
      object oriented programming for this game. I learned how to also animate
      the tail of the bison by using the setInterval function. I also incorporated
      a scrolling background.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://grasinskir.github.io/Asteroids" target="_blank">Master of Pie</a></h2>
      <p class="last">Master of Pie is my take on the arcade game Asteroids. I learned how to
      move an object across a screen in two dimensions and how to account for both
      the collisions of bullets and the space rocks. I implemented the idea of the
      space rocks splitting in two as they are destroyed. I also created the game
      so that it could be played either on a mobile device or a computer. The game
      features instructions and even a control panel just for mobile mode.</p>
